# **bellplay~** _algorithmic audio in bell_

### Description

**bellplay~** is a flexible application and framework for offline algorithmic audio in the bell programming language. Central to **bellplay~** is the concept of the _buffer_ — a structured data representation of an audio file. Buffers can be dynamically generated, processed, and manipulated using `bell` scripts. Each buffer encapsulates relevant audio information such as channel count, sampling rate, and duration, and can be extended to include additional, analysis-derived features like pitch, loudness, spectral centroid, and more.

Here are some the core features of **bellplay~**:
* **Bell programming**: script-based algorithmic audio, based on a simple programming language. No patching or Max experience needed.
* **Efficiency-driven**: ready-to-use infrastructure for offline algorithmic audio, minimizing boilerplate code and making it easy to quickly create audio algorithms.
* **User-friendly interface**: simple and accessible GUI.
* **Learning resources**: built-in, well-documented `bell` reference and introductory tutorials.
* **CAC-oriented**: audio buffers are represented as note events in roll notation, making it easier to understand and visualize the output.
* **Extensive algorithms**: a wide variety of audio processing, analysis, and synthesis algorithms. 
* **Multipass rendering**: no limitations on using output as input within a script, allowing for multiple stages of audio rendering.
* **Free**: No need to have a Max license to use it.

The general workflow of a bell script in **bellplay~** is the following:

1. _Generation_: buffers are created and processed using synthesis or sampling techniques. 
2. _Transcription_: created buffers are queued for rendering, each symbolically represented as a note in staff notation.
3. _Rendering_: All transcribed buffers are rendered into a single audio buffer. This buffer can then be used for subsequent iterations of this workflow to refine the final output as needed. 

Here’s an introductory example of a bell script in **bellplay~**, which generates 1 second of a sinusoidal wave at 440 Hz:


```py
## step 1: generate a buffer through synthesis
$buff = cycle(@frequency 440 @duration 1000);

## step 2: queue buffer for rendering
$buff.transcribe();

## step 3: trigger audio rendering
render()
```

With a wide variety of bell functions, **bellplay~** offers an extensive and flexible approach to algorithmic audio, enabling users to design intricate and complex sounds with granular precision. Moreover, its feature-based representation of buffers allows for more advanced audio techniques such as audio mosaicing and concatentive synthesis.

### Requirements

To use **bellplay~** in [Max](https://cycling74.com/downloads), you will need the following*:

- Max 8.6.2 or higher.
- Install the following packages through the Max Package Manager:
  - `bach`, `dada`, and `ears` by Andrea Agostini and Daniele Ghisi.
  - `ml.star` by Benjamin D. Smith.
  
> _NOTE: `bellplay~` is currently being developed and tested in MacOS (Intel and Apple silicon) — as such, some features may or may not work in Windows machines_.

### Acknowledgments
This project relies primarily on the [bach](https://bachproject.net) ecosystem — a family of packages for computer-assisted composition in Max, developed by Andrea Agostini and Daniele Ghisi. It also relies, to a lesser degree, on the [ml.star]([https://](https://www.benjamindaysmith.com/ml-machine-learning-toolkit-in-max)) library, developed by Benjamin D. Smith.
